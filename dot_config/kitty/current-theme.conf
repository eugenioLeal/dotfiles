# Window titlebar on Wayland systems (with client side window decorations such as GNOME)
# A value of system means to use the default system colors, a value of background means to use the background color of the currently active kitty window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

# Window titlebar on macOS.
# A value of system means to use the default system color, light or dark can also be used to set it explicitly. 
# A value of background means to use the background color of the currently active window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red. 
# WARNING: This option works by using a hack when arbitrary color (or background) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background color of the entire window and makes the titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are probably better off just hiding the titlebar with hide_window_decorations.
