# By default, binaries installed by gem will be placed into:
  # /opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin

# You may want to add this to your PATH.

# ruby is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
# because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
# parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

# If you need to have ruby first in your PATH, run:
  # echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

# For compilers to find ruby you may need to set:
  # export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/lib"
  # export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/include"

# For pkg-config to find ruby you may need to set:
  # export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/lib/pkgconfig"
